# Data Annotation Package

Data annotation is one of the most dependable factors on model performance, it serves as an important aspect of data quality control on Artificial Intelligence for health. This document is committed to give a general guideline of data annotation specification, including definition, background and goals, framework, standard operating procedure, scenario classifications and corresponding consistency criteria, as well as recommended metadata, etc.

This annotation module is built according to [FG-AI4H-DEL5.3](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/deliverables.aspx) (Proposed Standard for Data Annotation in Health) which specifies general requirements and guidelines for data annotation to ensure consistency and quality of the annotations. It applies to various types of data including, but not limited to, images, text, audio, and video. The standard covers both manual and automated methods of annotation and applies to all stages of the annotation process, including design, creation, quality assurance, and maintenance. The standard does not address specific annotation tasks or health domains.
